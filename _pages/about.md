I’m currently a Ph.D. student at INRIA since November 2019 within [RobotLearn team](https://team.inria.fr/robotlearn/). I'm supervised by [Xavier Alameda-Pineda](http://xavirema.eu/) and [Laurent Girin](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~laurent.girin/cv_en.html). My research interests are broadly involving computer vision and speech processing. Specifically, the deep sequential generative model, unsupervised speech enhancement and human motion.


I received my B.Sc. degree in Optical & Electronic Information from Huazhong University of Science & Technology, China, in 2016, the diplôme d’ingénieur from Institut d’Optique Graduate School, France, in 2018 and the M.Sc. in Signal & Image Processing from University Paris-Saclay, France, in 2018. My research interests are broadly in deep generative models and audio-visual applications.
