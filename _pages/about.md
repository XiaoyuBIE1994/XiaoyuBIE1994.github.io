Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. student at INRIA since December 2019 within [RobotLearn team](https://team.inria.fr/robotlearn/) (former [Perception team](https://team.inria.fr/perception/)). I'm supervised by [Xavier Alameda-Pineda](http://xavirema.eu/) and [Laurent Girin](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~laurent.girin/cv_en.html). I also collaborate closely with [Simon Leglaive](https://sleglaive.github.io/index.html) and [Francesc Moreno-Noguer](http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/fmoreno/).

My research interests are broadly involving computer vision and speech processing. Specifically, the deep sequential generative model, speech analysis and human understanding.


## News  
**Dec. 2021** We release the dataset [ExPI](https://team.inria.fr/robotlearn/multi-person-extreme-motion-prediction/). It contains 115 sequences of exteme Lindy Hop poses, with the 3D MoCap data (from 20 mocap cameras and manual label clean), multi-view images (from 68 synchronized cameras) and 3D shapes as a texured mesh. Download the [[data](https://zenodo.org/record/5578329#.YbtQ8H2ZM-T)] and the [[Code](https://github.com/GUO-W/MultiMotion)] to have a rapid try.  
**Oct. 2021** Our paper [Dynamical Variational Autoencoders: A Comprehensive Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12595) is accepted by [Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning](https://www.nowpublishers.com/MAL).  
**Jun. 2021** 1 paper accepted at [Interspeech 2021](https://www.interspeech2021.org/)  
**Aug. 2020** My first paper with my supervisors [Dynamical Variational Autoencoders: A Comprehensive Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12595) is avaiable on arXiv.  
**Dec. 2019** I start my PhD at Inria Grenoble.
