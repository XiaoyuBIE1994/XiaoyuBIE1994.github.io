Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at INRIA since December 2019 within [RobotLearn team](https://team.inria.fr/robotlearn/) (former [Perception team](https://team.inria.fr/perception/)). I'm supervised by [Xavier Alameda-Pineda](http://xavirema.eu/) and [Laurent Girin](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~laurent.girin/cv_en.html). I also collaborate closely with [Simon Leglaive](https://sleglaive.github.io/index.html) and [Francesc Moreno-Noguer](http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/fmoreno/). (Last update: Sep. 2022)

My research interests are broadly involving computer vision and speech processing. Specifically, the deep sequential generative model, speech analysis and human understanding.


## News  
**09/2022** I start a research internship at FAIR labs in Meta AI, I will work with [Alexei Baevski](https://ai.facebook.com/people/alexei-baevski), [Michael Auli](https://michaelauli.github.io/) and [Wei-Ning Hsu](https://wnhsu.github.io/).<br>
**03/2022** Our paper [Multi-Person Extreme Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08825) is accpeted to CVPR 2022.<br>
**12/2021** We release the dataset [ExPI](https://team.inria.fr/robotlearn/multi-person-extreme-motion-prediction/). It contains 115 sequences of exteme Lindy Hop poses, with the 3D MoCap data (from 20 mocap cameras and manual label clean), multi-view images (from 68 synchronized cameras) and 3D shapes as a texured mesh. Download the [[data](https://zenodo.org/record/5578329#.YbtQ8H2ZM-T)] and the [[Code](https://github.com/GUO-W/MultiMotion)] to have a rapid try.<br>
**10/2021** Our paper [Dynamical Variational Autoencoders: A Comprehensive Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12595) is accepted by [Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning](https://www.nowpublishers.com/MAL).<br>
**07/2021** I participate the [P.A.I.S.S. summer school](https://project.inria.fr/paiss/). <br>
**06/2021** 1 paper accepted at [Interspeech 2021](https://www.interspeech2021.org/).<br>
**08/2020** My first paper with my supervisors [Dynamical Variational Autoencoders: A Comprehensive Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12595) is avaiable on arXiv.<br>
**12/2019** I start my PhD at Inria Grenoble.<br>
