Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. student at INRIA since November 2019 within [RobotLearn team](https://team.inria.fr/robotlearn/). I'm supervised by [Xavier Alameda-Pineda](http://xavirema.eu/) and [Laurent Girin](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~laurent.girin/cv_en.html). I also collaborate closely with [Simon Leglaive](https://sleglaive.github.io/index.html) and [Francesc Moreno-Noguer](http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/fmoreno/).

My research interests are broadly involving computer vision and speech processing. Specifically, the deep sequential generative model, unsupervised speech enhancement and human motion.
